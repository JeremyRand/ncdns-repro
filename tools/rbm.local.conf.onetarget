  ### The clean configuration is used by the cleaning script to find the
  ### branches and build targets you are using, to compute the list of
  ### files that should be kept.
  ###
  ### If you only do alpha builds for all platforms, you can use the
  ### following configuration:
  clean:
    HEAD:
      - project: release
        target:
          - CHANNEL
          - ncdns-all
